## This Is PHPress

In a word, PHPress is a set of tools that makes working with WordPress a bit easier from a code maintainability standpoint. Whether you're working in Laravel, Symfony, or anything else (even WordPress) I hope you give this library some thought.

It's goal is to take some of the more cumbersome things about WordPress, like WPQuery or filtering content, and make them better.

For instance, by default you can't inject WordPress classes as dependencies inside of the controller. This project allows you to do that now.
